        <description>
        <p>Dhampirs are the half-living children of vampires birthed by human females. While they posses the charm and seductiveness of their undead parent, they do not suffer some of the same effects that come from being undead. Dhampirs live and die just like any other mortal creatures, despite possessing a supernatural longevity akin to that of elves. </p>
