        <description>
        <p>Kitsune, or fox folk, are vulpine shapeshifters known for their love of both trickery and art. Kitsune possess two forms: that of an attractive human of slender build with salient eyes, and their true form of a multi-tailed fox. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. They delight in the arts, particularly riddles and storytelling, and settle in ancestral clans, taking their wisdom from both the living and spirits. </p>
        <h4>KITSUNE TRAITS </h4>
        <p>Your Kitsune character has the following traits. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Trickster.</em></strong> You are proficient in Acrobatics and Deception. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Kitsune Magic.</em></strong> You know the Dancing Lights cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fox Form.</em></strong> As an action, you can transform into a fox, all of your equipment merges into your form. You retain all of your stats and can still speak normally. A creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 8 + your Deception bonus to discern that you are not a real fox. While in this form, you are a small creature, gain a bite attack equal to 1d4 damage (this counts as finesse), and gain advantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. You do not gain benefits of armor in this form so your AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier. Finally, due to your lack of hands and materials, the only spells you can cast in this form are ones that only have the verbal component. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Kitsune Tails.</em></strong> The amount of tails in your fox form is equal to the highest level spell you can cast. If you can’t cast spells, you still have one tail. You can choose whether or not you show all tails when you transform. </p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. </p>
