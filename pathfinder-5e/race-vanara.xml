        <p>Vanaras are intelligent, monkey-like humanoids that live in deep, warm forests and lush jungles. A Vanara’s body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Their years of living in trees have made them adept at climbing and traversing. While many Vanara’s can be quite mischievous, you will often find that they are wise and have inquisitive minds. </p>
